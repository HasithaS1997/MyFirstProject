Why is Security Penetration Testing Important?
Penetration testing attempts to compromise an organization’s system to discover security weaknesses. If the system has enough protection, security teams should be alerted during the test. Otherwise, the system is considered exposed to risk. Thus, penetration testing can contribute to improving information security practices.

A “blind” penetration test, meaning that security and operations teams are not aware it is going on, is the best test of an organization’s defenses. However, even if the test is known to internal teams, it can act as a security drill that evaluates how tools, people, and security practices interact in a real life situation.
